The main file is "index.html" and the website must be started from there.

Each webpage (apart from the Interactive Content) will have a "GO BACK" at the
top, from where the user can click and go back to the main menu.

Each Interactive Content will have to be opened separately since neither .py
files, nor .bat files can be used as a href in HTML.

Both Interactive content folders, "model_predictions" and "interactive_2"
have a README.md and a "requirements.txt" file each.

Please refer to the README files in both Interactive Content folders.
