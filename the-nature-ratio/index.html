            <p>The universe may be chaotic and unpredictable, but it's also a highly organized 
              physical realm shaped by the laws of mathematics.<br>
              Johannes Kepler wrote: "...the image of man and woman stems from the divine proportion. In my opinion, the propagation of plants and the progenitive acts of animals are in the same ratio."

          Leonardo Fibonacci came up with the sequence when calculating the ideal expansion pairs 
          of rabbits over the course of one year. Today, its emergent patterns and ratios 
          (phi = 1.61803...) can be seen from the microscale to the macroscale, and right 
          through to biological systems and inanimate objects. While the Golden Ratio doesn't 
          account for every structure or pattern in the universe, it's certainly a major player. 
          Here are some examples.

                <h2>Flowers and their Seed Heads</h2>
                <p>
                  The number of petals in a flower consistently follows the Fibonacci sequence. 
                  Famous examples include the lily, which has three petals, buttercups, which have 
                  five, the chicory's 21, the daisy's 34, and so on. Phi appears 
                  in petals on account of the ideal packing arrangement as selected by Darwinian 
                  processes; each petal is placed at 1.618034 radians per turn allowing 
                  for the best possible exposure to sunlight and other factors.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The head of a flower is also subject to Fibonaccian processes. Typically, seeds are 
                  produced at the center, and then migrate towards the outside to fill all the space. 
                  Sunflowers provide a great example of these spiraling patterns. In some cases, the seed 
                  heads are so tightly packed that total number can get quite high — as many as 144 or more. Plus 
                  when counting these spirals, the total tends to match a Fibonacci number. Interestingly, a 
                  highly irrational number is required to optimize filling. 
                  Phi fits the bill rather nicely.

                The unique properties of the Golden Rectangle provides another example. 
                This shape, a rectangle in which the ratio of the sides a/b is equal to the 
                golden mean (phi), can result in a nesting process that can be repeated into 
                infinity — and which takes on the form of a spiral. It's call the logarithmic spiral, and 
                it abounds in nature.

              <p>
                Snail shells and nautilus shells follow the logarithmic spiral, as does the cochlea 
                of the inner ear. It can also be seen in the horns of certain goats, and the shape of 
                certain spider's webs.

              <h2>Spiral Galaxies</h2>

              <p>
                Not surprisingly, spiral galaxies also follow the familiar Fibonacci pattern. 
                The Milky Way has several spiral arms, each of them a logarithmic spiral with a pitch 
                angle of about between 25 and 35 degrees. As an interesting aside, spiral galaxies appear to 
                defy Newtonian physics. 
                As early as 1925, astronomers realized that, since the angular speed of rotation of the 
                galactic disk varies with distance from the center, the radial arms should become curved as 
                galaxies rotate.
              </p>
              <!-- Parallax Effect -->
              <div class="parallax-window2" data-parallax="scroll" data-z-index="1" data-image-src="img/galaxy.jpg"></div>

              <p>
                Subsequently, after a few rotations, spiral arms should start to wind around a galaxy. 
                But they don't — hence the so-called winding problem. The stars on the outside, it would seem, 
                move at a velocity higher than expected — a unique trait of the cosmos that helps preserve its shape.

              <h2>Humans, Animals, and Our Wide Wide Nature</h2>

              <p>
                Apart from these, there are a variety of other manifestations of "The Divine Proportion"
                in nature. The branches of a tree, veins of a leaf and hurricanes are examples of these, to 
                name a few. Humans and animals too, possess the Golden Ratio. The golden ratio is at the heart of many of the proportions in the human body. These include the shape of the perfect face, the shape of the cochlea of the inner ear, and also the ratio of the height of the navel to the height of the body.
                The eye, fins and tail all fall at golden sections of the length of a dolphin’s body. The dimensions of the dorsal fin are golden sections (yellow and green). The thickness of the dolphin’s tail section corresponds to same golden section of the line from head to tail.
                The eye-like markings of this moth fall at golden sections of the lines that mark its width and length. Every key body feature of the angel fish falls at golden sections of its width and length. The nose, tail section, and centers of the fins of the angel fish fall at first (blue) golden sections.
                The eyes, beak, wing and key body markings of the penguin all fall at golden sections of its height.

                We've just begun the search in the never-ending ocean of nature and the universe. With just 5%
                of the seafloor and 35% of dry lands having been explored, nature is yet to unfold it's majesty
                and mysteriousness to mankind.
